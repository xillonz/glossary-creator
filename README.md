# Glossary Creator

## Description

A small html page that helps generate a glossary of terms.
Users can enter new terms, give them a description and even link them to other terms.
The page generates another html file that functions as a searchable glossary.

The generator and output can both run offline locally, or as a static page online, no backend required.

Existing outputs can be uploaded to the generator to continue modifying previous glossaries and generate a new updated version.
